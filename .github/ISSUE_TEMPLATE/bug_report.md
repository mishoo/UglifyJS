<!-- Note: sub-optimal but correct code is not a bug -->

**Uglify version (`uglifyjs -V`)**

**JavaScript input**

<!--
A complete parsable JS program exhibiting the issue with UglifyJS alone
- without third party tools or libraries.

Ideally the input should be as small as possible, but may be large if isolating
the problem proves to be difficult. The most important thing is that the
standalone program reliably exhibits the bug when minified. Provide a link to a
gist if necessary.

Solely providing minified output without the original uglify JS input is not
useful in determining the cause of the problem. Issues without a reproducible
test case will be closed.
-->

**The `uglifyjs` CLI command executed or `minify()` options used.**

<!--
Command-line or API call to UglifyJS without third party tools or libraries.
-->

**JavaScript output or error produced.**

<!--
Only minified code that produces different output (or error) from the original
upon execution would be considered a bug.
