**Bug report or feature request?** 

<!-- Note: sub-optimal but correct code is not a bug -->

**ES5 or ES6+ input?** 

<!-- Note: for ES6 see: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/harmony#harmony -->

**Uglify version (`uglifyjs -V`)**

**JavaScript input**

<!--
    A complete parsable JS program exhibiting the issue with
    UglifyJS alone - without third party tools or libraries.
    Ideally the input should be as small as possible.
    Post a link to a gist if necessary.

    Issues without a reproducible test case will be closed.

**The `uglifyjs` CLI command executed or `minify()` options used.**

**JavaScript output or error produced.**

<!--
    Note: `uglify-js` only supports ES5. 
    Those wishing to minify ES6 should use `uglify-es`.
