- Bug report or feature request?
- `uglify-js` version (`uglifyjs -V`)
- JavaScript input - ideally as small as possible.
- The `uglifyjs` CLI command executed or `minify()` options used.
- An example of JavaScript output produced and/or the error or warning.

Note: the release version of `uglify-js` only supports ES5. Those wishing to minify ES6 should use the experimental [`harmony`](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#harmony) branch.
